    At the beginning, the management of the courses in a new city can be overwhelming. But don't worry, there are people you
    can ask for help!
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    The first person to contact would always be the one in charge of the foreign students at your faculty.
    You most certainly already emailed him previous to your stay.
    <br>
    He will be able to help you with any questions regarding
    the university and especially your courses.
    <br>
    Additionally you can always contact the <a href="https://imp.ulpgc.es/contact/?lang=en">International Mobility Point</a>
